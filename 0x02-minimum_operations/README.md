# 0x02. Minimum Operations

This project is part of the ALX interview preparation curriculum. The task is to write a method that calculates the minimum number of operations required to produce exactly `n` characters (`H`) in a file using only two operations: **Copy All** and **Paste**.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file is mandatory
- Code should be documented
- Code must follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## File Structure

- `0-minoperations.py` — Contains the `minOperations(n)` function
- `0-main.py` — Used for testing the function

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
